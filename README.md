<H1>Welcome To MD Dashboards</H1>
This little project started as a little guide for helping people remember how to get to the Kudu Console for their Azure Website/apps. As a guide I created MD parts and added them to the dashboard. 

From that idea, combined with my love for Powershell and ARM I started working on a toolkit to create dashboards for Ibiza , without the clicking, dragging and configuring. 

This toolkit creates the MD part which includes a Markdown Table with all the sites, their hostnames and all their related management sites (Kudu, but also Monaco). Next to that I add basic Azure Insight telemetry parts for the App Service Plans and the Azure Web Apps. 

The goal is to create a fully automated dashboard generator, based upon Azure Inisghts telemetry and this for 

* Azure Web Apps
* Azure VM's
* Billing and Cost
* Security
* a combo of the above
